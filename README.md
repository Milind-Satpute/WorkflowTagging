Project Description: Workflow tagging is a machine learning project developed in Python to predict workflow tags using existing customer domain logs. This is my use case to help the project during the testing stage before going on prod so that the UAT team does not miss testing any particular workflow. 


Workflow Tagging Log Analysis Project in Python:
**Data Collection:**
Collect log data from your sources (files, databases, etc.).
**Data Preprocessing:**
Clean and preprocess the log data.
Tokenize and vectorize the text data.

**Labeling**:
Manually or semi-automatically label a subset of your log data with relevant workflow tags.


**Model Training:**
Split your data into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model using the labeled data.
